    "This project analyzes IPL player and match data to uncover patterns in batting performance, team strength, and venue scoring trends.  \n",
    "It also builds a regression model to predict total runs for a player in a season.\n",
    "## Importing Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We import essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading IPL Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We load the synthetic IPL dataset containing match-level and player-level information.  \n",
    "This includes player runs, teams, seasons, venues, and match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we clean missing values, standardize column names,  \n",
    "and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore the dataset using bar plots, heatmaps, and summaries  \n",
    "to understand patterns in batting performance, team strength,  \n",
    "and venue scoring behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Model: Predicting Player Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict  \n",
    "a player's total runs in a season using the available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the models using RMSE, R² score, residual plots,  \n",
    "and confusion matrices to understand prediction accuracy and error patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Insights & Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This section summarizes key learnings from the EDA and machine learning results.  \n",
    "We highlight top-performing players, strong teams, high-scoring venues,  \n",
    "and limitations in the prediction models.\n"

    "### 🔹 Team Win Percentage Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, and Rajasthan Royals show strong overall win rates,  \n",
    "consistently maintaining over 52% wins across seasons.  \n",
    "Teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals fall behind, with win percentages in the mid-40s,  \n",
    "indicating weaker performance and lower consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Venue Scoring Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "M. Chinnaswamy Stadium stands out as the highest-scoring venue,  \n",
    "with several seasons crossing the 380–400 run mark.  \n",
    "In contrast, MA Chidambaram and Arun Jaitley Stadiums show lower average totals,  \n",
    "highlighting bowler-friendly conditions at these grounds.  \n",
    "The heatmap clearly shows how venue characteristics influence scoring patterns.\n",

    "## 📊 What the ML Results Reveal\n",
    "\n",
    "The models struggled to capture the complexity of a player's season performance.  \n",
    "Since features like strike rate, innings played, batting position, form, and match context were missing,  \n",
    "the algorithms could not learn meaningful patterns.  \n",
    "This demonstrates that cricket performance prediction requires richer, more detailed data.\n"
